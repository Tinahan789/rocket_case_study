# Rocket Mortgage Case Study
The case study is based on an example from UC Irvineâ€™s [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

Problem definition: 

The aforementioned data set includes direct marketing campaigns (i.e. phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (indicated in the y variable). The longer term task for this project will be to create a model that will help this banking institution determine, in advance, clients who will be receptive to such marketing campaigns. For this case study, we ask you to take the first steps toward that goal. We ask you to review the dataset and perform initial EDA to inform what initial round of models that you would build to solve this problem. (You do not need to build models as part of this work) The goal is to see how you code and to give us a flavor of how you would attack a new problem, what your initial strategy would be, and what influenced that strategy.
