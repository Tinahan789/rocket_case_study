# Rocket Mortgage Case Study

We are using the Bank Marketing data set from UC Irvineâ€™s [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing). We will perform an EDA on the data with the long term goal in mind: to create a data-driven method of determining whether a client will be receptive to telephone marketing campaigns. We will get an inital understanding of the feature distribution, how features are related, and use these insights to propose a plan for next steps.

## Data
The data is directly imported into the python environment using the `ucimlrepo` library.

## Required Libraries
- `ucimlrepo`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Contents
